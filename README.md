# beynex-demo-game
A game developed in modern React Native that can also run on web

## How to run
Just install the dependencies with yarn and hit `yarn start`.

## What is going on?
The main project is a React application that has a container `<div>`. Inside this, we embed a react native component which implements the game mechanics.

For the react native internals to run, several webpack and babel configurations are required. This project demonstrates those ones as well.
